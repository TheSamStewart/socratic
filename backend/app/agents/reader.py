CONCEPTS_PROMPT = f"""You read a university student's submission and record the ideas it depends on. You do not judge it.

The JSON has one field, "submission". Return 4 to 6 concepts (a short text, such as a lab with only a few points, may have fewer: return only the ones it really makes), each a named research or subject idea the argument relies on, such as "Correlation vs causation" or "Self-report bias".
- id: "c1", "c2", and so on.
- name: the standard textbook term for the idea, in 2 to 5 words, not a description of this essay. Where the student reasons from an association to a cause, the term is "Correlation vs causation", whatever reason they give for doing so. Other standard terms include Sampling, Self-report bias, Cross-sectional design and Mediating variables.
- claim: what the student says about this idea, stated neutrally and faithfully, even if it is wrong.
- quote: the single full sentence where the student relies on the idea, copied character for character. No ellipses, no edits, no joined sentences.
- confidence: from 0 to 1, how sure you are that the quote shows this concept.

Choose the concepts where the student's reasoning does the most work. Give each concept a different quote. If the text makes no argument of the student's own, for example an assignment brief, a rubric or notes with no claims, return an empty concepts list.

- criterion: its name as written.
- weight: its percentage of the mark as a number, for example 40. Use 0 if the rubric gives no weights.
